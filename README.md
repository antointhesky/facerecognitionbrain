# SmartBrain 

## Description
SmartBrain is a React-based web application that utilizes AI-powered face detection. Users can sign up, log in, and enter an image URL, and the app will detect faces in the image using the Clarifai API. The frontend provides an intuitive interface to interact with the AI model and track user submissions.
